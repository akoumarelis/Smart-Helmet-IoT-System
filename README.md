This project is an implementation of a smart flash ecosystem for bicycles, which the cyclist can handle with his helmet when they will light up and the bike will take various measurements. The system consists of two main parts, the helmet, and the bicycle saddle. The cyclist, depending on the movements he makes with the helmet, lights up the corresponding flash or alarm as we will see in detail in the next chapters. The bicycle saddle receives commands via ESP-NOW from the helmet about when each flash will light up and sends back data from a pressure sensor located on the saddle that understands when each route starts.
